# Investigating the effect of dimensional reduction on classification mnist784
This is an experiment to determine whether dimensional reduction with principal component analysis increases accuracy and decreases training time of machine learning classification algorithms, or makes it worse


The dataset used in this machine learning experiment is the MNIST784 dataset which is a dataset of pixel darkness values of a of a 28x28 grid of images of handwritten numbers written by children, and photographed. Dimensional reduction reduces computation time by reducing the number of dimensions the classifiers are trained with and use for classification and hence the number of operations the machine needs to run. As there are 784 dimensions (1 for each pixel) in the dataset - which is many - there is large potential for dimensional reduction to improve machine learning training time and classification accuracy.
